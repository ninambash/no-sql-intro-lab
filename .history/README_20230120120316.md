# NoSQL Research Lab

## Explainer

Up until now in the cohort we have stored data only in what are known as relational databases (SQL is the most well known type of relational DB querying language). Relational databases structure our data into tables. Today we will learn about a different type of database: a non-relational one. 

## Lab

In this lab you will be researching, either individually or in groups, answer to the following questions about noSQL databases. The intention is for you to spend some time learning about the fundamental differences between the type of databases we have seen before and the new type we will be learning about today. Even more importantly, you will learn about why two types of databases are used, and what situations fit each type of db. 

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository and answer questions as you research directly in the README. You do not have to submit this lab, but you will want to have it on hand for reference in the future. 

## Questions:

1. What does the term noSQL refer to, and what other term is often used synonymously with noSQL?

  NoSQL stands for "not only SQL" and refers to a type of database management system (DBMS) that does not use a fixed schema and does not rely on the relational model. These databases are often used for big data and real-time web applications. The term "non-relational" is often used synonymously with NoSQL.


  NoSQL stands for "not only SQL" and refers to a type of database that does not use a fixed schema and does not rely on SQL for querying data. These databases are often used for big data and real-time web applications. The term "non-relational" is often used synonymously with NoSQL to describe these types of databases.

  NoSQL refers to a type of database management system that does not use a fixed schema and is not based on the relational model. The data is typically stored in a non-tabular format, such as a document, key-value, graph, or object store.
  NoSQL databases are often used to store and manage large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and are designed to scale horizontally.
  The term "non-relational" is often used synonymously with NoSQL.


2. In this class we will be using the document style of non-relational databases. What are the charecteristics of a document based db? 

    A document-based NoSQL database uses a document data model, which stores data in semi-structured formats, such as JSON or XML. Each document typically contains a set of fields, and each field has a name and a value. The documents are stored in a collection, which is similar to a table in a relational database. Some of the main characteristics of a document-based database include:

    Flexible schema: Each document can have a different set of fields and structure, which allows for easy evolution of the data model over time.

    Strong consistency: All the data of a document is stored together, which allows for strict consistency model and easy querying of the data.

    High scalability: They can handle large amounts of unstructured data and are designed to scale horizontally.

    Rich query capabilities: Document databases often have built-in support for rich querying and indexing, which allows for efficient retrieval of data based on various criteria.

    High performance: Document databases are optimized for high-performance read and write operations, which makes them well-suited for use cases such as online transaction processing and real-time analytics.


    ----2---------------
              A document-based database, also known as a document store or document-oriented database, is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in the form of documents, typically represented in a format such as JSON or BSON. Some characteristics of a document-based database include:

          Schema-less: A document-based database does not have a fixed schema, which means that the structure of the data can vary from document to document. This makes it easy to add new fields or change the structure of the data without having to update the schema.

          Self-contained: Each document in a document-based database contains all the information about that particular piece of data, including any related data. This makes it easy to retrieve and update data without having to perform joins across multiple tables.

          Strong Consistency: Document-based databases are strong consistent in nature. Each document is atomic and will always be in a consistent state.

          Easily Scalable: Document-based databases are easily scalable, as they are typically designed to scale horizontally by distributing the data across multiple servers.

          Good for unstructured data: Document-based databases are well suited for storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as text, images, and multimedia.








3. In this class we will be using Mongo specificially as our no-SQL db. Look into Mongo and answer this question: what is the priamry difference between how Mongo is maintained vs SQL?

      MongoDB is a popular document-based NoSQL database management system. The primary difference between MongoDB and SQL databases is in the way they handle data and maintain consistency.

      Data model: MongoDB uses a document-based data model, which means that data is stored in a format similar to JSON or BSON. This makes it easy to store and query unstructured and semi-structured data. In contrast, SQL databases use a table-based data model, where data is stored in a series of rows and columns.

      Schema: MongoDB is a schema-less database, which means that it does not enforce a fixed schema on the data. This allows for more flexibility in how data is stored, but also means that it may be more difficult to enforce data consistency across documents. SQL databases, on the other hand, have a fixed schema, which makes it easier to enforce data consistency, but also means that it can be more difficult to add new fields or change the structure of the data.

      Consistency: MongoDB uses a concept called "eventual consistency" which means that all copies of the data will eventually be consistent with each other, but there may be a delay before all copies are updated. SQL databases, on the other hand, use a concept called "strong consistency" which means that all copies of the data are updated immediately and are always in a consistent state.

      Scale: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means that it can easily handle large amounts of data by distributing it across multiple servers. SQL databases, on the other hand, are more limited in how they can scale, and may require more complex solutions such as sharding or partitioning to handle large amounts of data.

      Query Language: MongoDB uses its own query language called the MongoDB Query Language (MQL) which is different from SQL. It's also has an API interface to interact with the MongoDB databases.

4. Mongo DBs are organized into documents. Describe an example of a table in SQL that contains users, and then describe the equivalent DB setup in Mongo. 
5. What is an example situation where a non-relational database makes more sense versus a relational db?
6. What are the benefits of SQL databases? NoSQL Databases?
7. Explain the differences between ACID and BASE models.
